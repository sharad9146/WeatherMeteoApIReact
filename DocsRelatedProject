In this project I had done following things:

1)Firstly starting I have created a folder name as weather-app-yt .
2)Now i had added dependency related to tailwind css
3)Now i open the documentation of open-meteo api and then select checboxes based on temperature like 
humidity, windspeed, temperature
4)Afterward i had copied API link from below
5) Afterward i open the project with vs code and then install dependency for tailwind css
6) Afterward i had open material-ui icon and then install it's dependecy
7) Now i deownload the country-state-city npm package
8) Now i install npm react-select package
9) Now i want to create selection from city and country such that select is used for it.
10) For adding country and city i had made seperate function for them so that they can be handled seperately.
11) Since i had used package then i can select any country and it's city  , i had also provide get weather button
which provides result of it.
12) Afterward i try to print longitude and latitude of it.
13) Now i want to make these things in left align so i uses flex for it then it would get left aligned.
and whenever user click on get weather button then temperature, humidity and wind speed would be get printed.
14) Now i had installed so that i can use card,and display temperature humidity on centre. Also i want to use
open-meteo-api hence i had installed it.
15)Now for fetching the data using the api i am using variable for it.And then setWeatherDetails from this constant
16) Now i had stored hunidity , temperature , windspeed in the variable and displaying it in three column using flex for it. Hence it become more visible.
17) Created several div tag for it and store these things on it.
